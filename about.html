    OUR OBJECTIVE
    <br><br>
    Long Beach Japanese Language School is unique among Japanese language schools in California. We are not a traditional school serving only Japanese heritage students. Our objective is to serve students of all ages, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, many of whom come with no previous Japanese language or cultural knowledge. Our instruction emphasizes the Japanese way of thinking, its cultural mannerisms and customs. We are dedicated to educating people who are interested in Japan and want to widen the...(line truncated)...
    <br><br>
    LBJLS is also unique because we offer Introductory-Beginner classes in each of our age group divisions: Children, Youth, and High School/Adult. Our students also do not automatically get promoted each year. Instead, our promotions are based on progress and ability, so students will always feel comfortable at their assigned grade level.
    <br><br>
    Our Children’s Division for ages 5-7 emphasizes the “atmosphere” and “approach” of Japanese culture and language, in combination with fun learning experiences. Our Youth Division for ages 8-13 prepares students for high school language programs. Our High School/Adult Division for ages 14+ can result in fulfilling high school language credits and college entrance requirements. We also have many adult students who want to learn Japanese language and culture for professional or personal satisfaction.
