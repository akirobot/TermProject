            		<h2>Children's Division - Age 5-8 </h2>
            		<p>Very young children are introduced to Japanese language and culture in a comfortable learning atmosphere by using pictures, music, videos, origami, crafts and games. Children will gradually absorb language and culture through the use of their eyes, ears and voice.</p>
            	</div>

            	<div id="youthDiv">
            		<h2>Youth Division - Age 8-13 </h2>
            		<p>Beginner to early intermediate classes are offered to elementary and middle school youth, ages 8 to 13. This division is designed for students to acquire the language skills and cultural knowledge needed to transfer smoothly into high school Japanese language programs. Class Levels 1-3 will accommodate young students based on individual learning ability and progress rather than strict age levels.</p>

            		<div id="ydLevel1">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 1</p> Introduction to Japanese language and culture with an emphasis on oral expression, including greetings, phrases, simple sentences and short dialogues. Hiragana is gradually introduced–first through reading, then basic writing by the end of the school year. Music, crafts and games using language are also part of the experience.</p>
            		</div>

            		<div id="ydLevel2">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 2</p> Communication and oral drills are emphasized. Students learn to read short sentences written in Hiragana. Reading is also encouraged using story books. Gradually, Katakana and very simple Kanji are introduced.</p>
            		</div>

            		<div id="ydLevel3">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 3</p> Students will be asked to communicate with longer phrases and sentences, both orally and in writing. Story reading and reading comprehension will increase. Stronger use of Katakana and additional Kanji are included.</p>

            	<div id="HSAdultDiv">
            		<h2>High School/Adult Division - Age 14-Adult Seniors</h2>
            		<p>Beginner to intermediate classes are offered for high school students and adults, ages 14 and up, from all cultural backgrounds and language levels. Class Levels 1-4 are designed to accommodate each student on the basis of individual learning ability and progress, rather than strict age levels. LBJLS also offers language credit testing for 9th graders and above.</p>

            		<div id="HSAdultLevel1">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 1</p> Beginning class for high school students and adults who have never studied Japanese. The focus is on communication, including greetings, simple sentences and customary phrases. Hiragana is introduced and oral drills are emphasized. Later in the year, Katakana and simple Kanji are introduced. The objective is for students to communicate orally and in writing using basic grammar and expressions.</p>	
            		</div>

            		<div id="HSAdultLevel2">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 2</p> For students who have completed Level 1 or have studied Japanese for 1 to 2 years, this class continues to build on the Level 1 objectives of oral and written communication. Students will be challenged with more complicated grammar, reading and Kanji study.</p>	
            		</div>

            		<div id="HSAdultLevel3">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 3</p> For students who have completed Level 2 or have studied Japanese for 2 to 3 years, this class has a greater emphasis on reading comprehension through reading and explaining paragraphs in Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Weekly work includes Kanji study and paragraph writing.</p>	
            		</div>

    				<div id="HSAdultLevel4">
            			<p><p class="levels">Level 4</p> This class is for students who have studied Japanese in college for at least 3 years or have lived in Japan and want to polish their speaking, reading and writing skills. It is highly recommended for students who want to take The Japan Foundation’s Level 3 or 4 Proficiency Tests. Writing summaries and essays, translating English into Japanese, and exchanging ideas orally are expected at this level.</p>
